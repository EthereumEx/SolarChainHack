# //oneweek 2016 SolarChain

![SolarChain diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomconte/tomconte.github.io/master/images/ApolloChain.png)

The SolarChain system consists of:

- An Ethereum Smart Contract that allows selling energy for coins ("ApolloCoins") and then reusing these coins later to buy additional energy from the grid when needed.
- A device process that measures excess energy produced in KW/h and automatically sells this energy via the contract.
- A user interface ("Wallet") that allows an end-user to track the energy he sold, and allows him to use some of his accumulated coins to buy additional energy.
- (TODO) A device process that can use available (purchased) energy to power a device.
